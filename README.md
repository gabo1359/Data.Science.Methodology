These stages will help us to solve different questions in order to solve an specific problem:

  1. What is the problem that you are trying to solve?
  2. How can you use data to answer the question?
  3. What data do you need to answer the question?
  4. What is the data coming from and how will you get it?
  5. Is the data that you collected representative of the problem to be solved?
  6. What additional work is required to manipulate and work with data?
  7. In what way can the data be visualized to get to the answer that is required?
  8. Does the model used really answer the initial question or does it need to be adjusted?
  9. Can you put the model into practice?
  10. Can you set constructive feedback into answering the question?
